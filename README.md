## Problem Description
This project is aimed at solving the Diagonal Magic Cube problem for a 5x5x5 cube. The objective is to arrange unique integers from 1 to 125 within the cube so that specific properties of a magic cube are met.

A magic cube of dimension 5x5x5 requires arranging numbers 1 to 125 in such a way that:
- Each row, column, and pillar sums up to a predefined *magic number*.
- Each space diagonal (running through the entire cube in 3D) also sums to the magic number.
- All diagonals in each 2D slice of the cube meet the magic number requirement.
